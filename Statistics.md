Statistics - Sciense of collecting ,organizing and analysing data 

- Types of Statistics:
  	1. Descriptive - Ask about the data
    	2. Inferential - Measure or form conclusion from the data 



- Data is from Either population or Samples,

  1. Population is the Group  Generally Size is represented as N
  2. Sample is the subset Generally size is represented as n
     1. Why do we sample  - it is because of the size of the populatio 
     2. Types:
        1. Simple Random - as the chances of occurance is same for each element 
        2. Startified Sample - split into non overlapping groups and then take random samples
        3. Systematic Smaple - every nth records is placed in a sample
        4.   Convenient Sample (Worst) - Easiest obtained from the population . might create bia
- Variables - is a property that can take on may values. its always in sigular

  - there are two types
    1. Quantitative Variable -  its a meausrable (int and float)
       - Discrete - like dice roll
       - Continuou - like temperature
    2. Qualitative Variable - Allows for calssification based on some charecteristics  (Category)
- Independent and Dependent Variables

  - Independent Variables - that are being manuplatied or controlled by users
  - Dependant variable - that are being measures 
- Variable Measurement Scale - 

  1. Nomial - Categorical Data
  2. Ordinal - Data where order matters but distance dosn't matter
  3. Interval - Order matters but distaces are equal no natual zero available
  4. Ratio - Data where order matters and distances are equal and natural zero available
- Frequency Distribution - Measure of each category 
- graphing -

  -  Categorical data:
    - Bar chart - X is category and y is the measure
    - Pie chart - Proption of a category to the total in a circle format
  - Quantitative data:
    - Histogram - is a frequcy table where as a the data with x in the bin and y is the count
- Arithmetic Mean - A Single value to show the details of the data set

  - Population mean - $\mu$
  - Sample mean - Xbar
- Centeral tendency:

  - Mean - Average of all the values 
  - Median - the value in the middile. if the total are even ten its the avg of the middel two number
  - Mode - most frequently available value
- Variance and Standard Deviation of population and sample

  - When two data set have same mean how do we comapre ?
  - Dipersion is the spread of data from the mean. we measure this using variance and standard deviation
  - standard deviation is square root of variance
- Percentile and Quartiles

  - Percentile - a value below which a certain percentage of the data lie
  - Quartile - 25, 50 and 75 percentils are the 3 quatiles
- Five number Summary - Min, First Quartile, Median, Third Quartile, Max
- Interquatile range (IQR)  = Q3-Q1

  1. Lower fence = Q1 - 1.5(IQR)

  2. Upper fence = Q3 + 1.5(IQR)
  3. Outlier = anything that is not between lower and upper fence
     - Becaseue of outliers it changes the mean and std.dev but dosn't affect a lot with median
- Skewness -

  - if not skewed then the mean is in the center
  - Left & right - its mean is in the left or right respectively
- The distributiion of the most continuous random variable wil follow normal curve

  - the central tendency will be closer to mean , median and mode
  - Area in the normal distribution curve is. always 1 
  - 68% will be between 1 std dev
  - 95% wil be between 2 std dev
  - 99% will be between 3 std dev
- Z Score  - Standardized value that can be used to compare scores in differnt distribution

  - in short tell how far above or below the mean 
- Probability - Measure of a a likelyhood. its always between 0 and 1

  - if mutually exlucive them we have to add the probability
  - if not mutully exclusice then and the probability of events  minus the probaibilty of the intersection
  - Indepence of event - if two event don't affect one another
  - dependent - if the evnt affects one another
- Permutation - the order matters
- Combinations - the order dosen't matter
- random variable  is a variable which hhas its value determined by a probability experiment
- Binomial distribution - 

  1. it repeates fixed number of times
  2. trial is independent
  3. has two mutually exclusive outcomes
  4. Probability of sucess is same for all trial
- Poisson probability Distribution:

  - is used when computing the probability of certain number of successes within a specified interval
  - the probability of sucess is a small enough interval 
  - probability of a success is the same for any two interval which share the same length 
  - success is the interval is independent
- Persons'r - measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables . its between -1 and 1
- Spearman correlation - measures the strength of the non linear relationship between two variables. its between -1 and 1
- Correlation - when two variables are kind of related 
- Causation - when one variable causes something to happen on another variable
- Student t distribution - used when we don't know the population standard deviations

  - it has n-1 degree of freedom
